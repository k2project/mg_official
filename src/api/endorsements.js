Murray Grant joined us in 2018 on the DanceStar South Africa qualifiers judging panel and has truly been one of our favourite judges over the past years. Judging two qualifiers with over 1800 routines for 11 days, Murray was professional all the time scoring each routine fairly and writing valuable feedback for each dance. Murray was the entire time courteous, warm and friendly and freely sharing he’s valuable knowledge of dance with all the South African dancers, teachers and staff. After the two week event I realised that Murray does all of this because he has an immense passion for dance and loves sharing this passion with dancers from all over the world. We would be honoured to have Murray anytime back in South Africa.'

I was thrilled to get the opportunity to work with his students in Edinburgh - and he and his team at MGA are doing incredible work with the students as they venture into the professional world of show business. I also appreciate his passion for bringing Broadway artists to the UK as part of a mutually-fulfilling cultural exchange of ideas. His passion for bringing the arts to his hometown of Edinburgh is contagious and inspiring. I hope to have many more collaborations with Murray in the future.'
